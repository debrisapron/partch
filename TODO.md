Next

- Write proper intro/guide
- More recipes
- More tests

Then

- Pass params to synth voices
- Simple functions in connection strings: * / + -
- Param aliases
- Get rid of out node on patch - connect can just patch all output nodes to destination
- If only one node connected from patch input, make that the input node
- Tuning base & tuning function, on library setup & per call
- Array nodes e.g. 3 oscillators
- More nodes:
  - Dynamics
  - Pulse osc with pw https://github.com/pendragon-andyh/WebAudio-PulseOscillator
  - TriSaw osc with shape
  - Supersaw osc https://noisehack.com/how-to-build-supersaw-synth-web-audio-api/
  - Moog filter
  - Granular sample node
  - FFT sample node!?!?!?
  - Bitcrusher (from Tuna)
  - Overdrive (from Tuna)
  - Freeverb
  - Panner (from WAA, need to understand how it works first :/)
  - Pitch shift
  - Amp follower
  - Pitch follower!?!?!?
