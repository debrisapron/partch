Next

- Start all nodes on creation
- Dedicated names for osc waveforms & filter types
- Creation args for CV inputs
- Instantiate sample node with URL
- Dynamics
- Write intro/guide
- More recipes
- Tests!

Then

- Get rid of out node on patch - connect can just patch all output nodes to destination
- If only one node connected from patch input, make that the input node
- Tuning base & tuning function, on library setup & per call
- Array nodes e.g. 3 oscillators
- More nodes:
  - Granular sample node
  - FFT sample node!?!?!?
  - Bitcrusher (from Tuna)
  - Overdrive (from Tuna)
  - Freeverb
  - Panner (from WAA, need to understand how it works first :/)
  - Pitch shift
  - Amp follower
  - Pitch follower!?!?!?
